For this assignment I was tasked with working with a client on their gaming software. I completed a design template, developed code to complete the programming portion of the project, and analyzed platform options for which to run the application from. The Gaming Room client software requirements included that the program be runnable on diverse platforms, utilize their library of images, utilize programming languages that efficiently run in a web-based environment, considering the different platformsâ€™ hardware requirements.

Overall, I am proud of what I accomplished with this assignment. Being as new to the subject as I am, this demonstrates great progress and acquisition of knowledge regarding development platforms. Particularly, I felt I did best on the evaluation of the different platforms. For this section we were tasked with comparing the development tools, server side and client side of each platform. I also received good feedback on the section involving the security recommendation. 

When developing the code for this program, I found it helpful to reference the domain model UML diagram. This helped display the flow of the program, and give insight into how to correct the code. I also found additional resources, both from the course and online, to be beneficial to the completion of coding the program.

One part of the assignment I would choose to revise a bit would be within the recommendations section, specifically the architecture, memory management, and distributed systems and management portions. These could have been more accurate to the rubric.

I considered the users needs by paying attention to what they wanted, and trying to implement ways to achieve their goals. One important consideration is storage and memory management. Furthermore, considering future growth is an important point. It is important to consider the clients needs in order to be most effective and accurate with the design of the program.

I approached designing software as a newcomer, paying attention to the lessons learned and feedback given through the process. I had to utilize the resources I had access to and follow the clients domain model and program considerations in order to produce my final product.
